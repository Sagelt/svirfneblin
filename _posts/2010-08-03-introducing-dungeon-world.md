I'll be bringing something new and exciting to GenCon, and I'm making it available here first. I created a new edition of <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=i35st8blgc47gre6v3ft0nc4v10umgfr&board=19.0" target="_blank">Tony Dowler's Dungeon World</a> (formerly Apocalypse D&D) with more classes, more moves, and rules that are a little more self-contained, and from now on it'll be available at <a href="http://www.latorra.org/dungeon-world/">http://www.latorra.org/dungeon-world/</a>. Dungeon World is Dungeons and Dragons viewed through the lens of <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/" target="_blank">Apocalypse World</a>, two great games that game great together.

Go, download it, and play it. I'll be running a series of dungeons at GenCon, if I get the chance, and I'll be posting about them here.
