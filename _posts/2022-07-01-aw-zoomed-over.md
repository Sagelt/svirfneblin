After [our The One Ring game](https://svirfnebl.in/2022/03/10/nine-sessions-of-the-one-ring-written-in-tv-guide-style/) went on indefinite hiatus we bounced around systems a little before settling on Apocalypse World: Burned Over which turned out to be an excellent fit. It pulls AW a bit more towards an action movie feel that worked great for us. And of course I kept writing episode summaries in the style of TV guide, but now with _episode titles!_

Unlike with our TOR game where I joined a few sessions in and didn't start writing episode summaries until way in this game was shorter (16 sessions) and I wrote a summary for each which leads to the whole thing reading more like a British show with distinct series. Our game changer GM switch mid-way through also makes for a nice series/season break. All together this reads more like a complete campaign log and more like an actual show summary which is kind of wonderful and has me more sold on this approcah. With our next game being a pulp sci-fi reskin of D&D 5E that we call Jank Starfighter after the title character I expect the summaries to continue to be a great tool.

My somewhat revised process is now:

1. Take live notes during the game in both my notebook and a shared doc. We don't really _need_ both, but I like hand written notes and they help me focus, but the collaborative digital notes are a useful reference and a fun way to commentate on the game as it happens.
2. The day before we game I write up the episode summary based on the notes and send it to our group chat plus add it to a separate summaries doc. I have a weekly repeating task to remind me since [that's how I work.](https://svirfnebl.in/2022/02/23/productivity/)
3. When the game wraps I post them all

Which brings us to the episodes:

### Season 1, Episode 1: Pilot (2022-01-22)

A bounty of shark meat at the Raftlands draws old friends Gremlin, Crow Dazzle, Vulture, and Founder back together. While Crow is enjoying the free meat Side-Pockets finds him and says someone needs help, bad. That someone turns out to be the notorious Skib, a gang leader who got bit by something in the water.

With Vulture’s help and a crash landing along the way Crow is able to get what he needs to save Skib at The Tower thanks to Gremlin’s cousin Crackers, but when the shark that attacked Skib turns out to be a setup from Burgundy, Burgundy makes off with part of Skibs’ gang.

[^1]: I've kept episode names as we named them at the time, so this one doesn't make a _ton_ of sense. Bacially we used "no sex moves" as our ["that's what she said"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBUGfs9rwms) or ["title of your sex tape"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIc6dh_YL4) since AW: Burned Over doesn't have sex moves. This session had so many thrusters and jacking in and tubes that it got this title.

[^2]: Another episode title that comes down to a joke in the session.
