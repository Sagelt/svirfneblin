# Here We Are

This is a game. You'll play it with a few friends (2-4 is best). One of you will describe a world much like our own but with something not-quite-right. We call them the **GM.** They will take their own fears and bring them to life in a way that goes beyond the real. They will add a **rot** to the world.

The rest will take on the roles of people caught up in the path of that rot. We call the characters they play **player characters.** The player characters are random people picked from the world the GM describes, like picking a random person from a phone book.

The people playing the game will get to decide what the player characters say, think, and do. There is no set plot and no set way to respond to the rot around them. They can run away, shelter in place, or fight back, or some of all of those.

You'll play to find out what happens.
