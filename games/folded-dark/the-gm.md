# Being Everything Else

# Creating The Rot

The rot is your fears made unreal.

At its center the rot is you. It is what you fear in the world, but made manifest in a way that's more real than reality. You'll take your fears and give them a life which is more literal, more real, than you could see in the world around you.

The rot is what drives the player characters' lives out of their daily life of mundane loops. They are normal people caught in the path of something terrible made real. Since the rot drives the player characters to action you'll need to plan it out before you start. How far ahead is up to you: you could come up with it as the players make their characters, or keep a notebook of ideas. There are also a few sample rots included here if you're very short on time.
