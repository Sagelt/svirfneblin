# Being Everything Else

As the GM you are everything else. You're the family, friends, and acquaintances of the player characters. You're the cold wind and the sunset and the four walls around them. You're everytthing else.

Doing that is a big job, but a rewarding one. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to be creative in every aspect of every moment. From your position as everything else, the world may be simple—a shadowy paramilitary organization lost their child-weapon who could cross in to a parallel world, say—but the players and their characters see only bits and pieces, dimly. With their partial information even something relatively straightforward can feel like a complex mystery to untangle. Your ideas may seem straightforward because they are yours. Someone else playing with you might find your straightforward idea completely unexpected.

To be everything else you'll rely on two main tools: your **notes** and the **rot** (the creeping fear the player characters are wrapped up in). The rot drives play as it throws the player characters' lives out of normal and your notes help you drive events forward.

You'll track the rot in your notes, so first we'll cover how to take notes. Then you'll create your rot, note it down, and use your notes to drive further play.

## Your Notes

To manage being everything else you'll need notes. A notebook is a good idea (I like the Leuchtturm 1917), but you can use lose paper if needed. Your notes are how you'll generate ideas, track play as it happens, and drive the game forward.

Your notes will be a series of entries, each starting with a mark. You **top-level** entries are the main list. Some entries will have other entries **under** them, indented a bit to the right. (Using grid or dotted paper makes it easier to indent consistently).

The mark before an entry indicates what kind of entry it is:

- Entries starting with a triangle facing forward (‣) are **questions to be resolved.**
- Entries that start with a dot (-) are **observations or ideas**
- Entries beginning with a small circle (○) are **things that happened.**

Keep each entry as brief as possible, just enough to remind you what happened. Add an entry for anything that strikes you, even if it might not be important later on.

When an entry is part of another entry, put it under that entry. For example, an entry for an event where Marcia holes up in her house, rigging it with traps, might have observations under it about how this might look to others and questions about how her neighbors will react when they come to check on her.

Start each session with a header noting the date you're playing (top-level, no mark). Add entries underneath it as needed. You'll use these entries to plan future sessions, but more on that in a bit. First you'll need a rot to drive play.

# The Rot

The rot is your fears made unreal.

At its center the rot is you. It is what you fear in the world, but made manifest in a way that's more real than reality. You'll take your fears and give them a life which is more literal, more real, than you could see in the world around you.

The rot is what drives the player characters' lives out of their daily life of mundane loops. They are normal people caught in the path of something terrible made real. Since the rot drives the player characters to action you'll need to plan it out before you start. How far ahead is up to you: you could come up with it as the players make their characters, or keep a notebook of ideas. There are also a few sample rots included here if you're very short on time.

The rot is **manifest, specific, deniable** and **beyond reality.** Manifest means that it is obvious and clear to those that encounter it, but deniable means that its presence isn't ovious to the masses. Specific means that it is working towards a particular goal in a particular way; it has a plot. Beyond reality means that it dials up your fear beyond how it appears in the world around you. Make it more manifest, more specific, and set it lose.

## Creating The Rot

To create your rot, start with something you fear. It can be a personal fear (bees, heights, earthquakes) but the best rots come from something more systematic (inequality, discrimination, environmental collapse). Take that fear and chose one key aspect of the rot (manifest, specific, deniable, beyond real) and amplify that aspect of it. Repeat this process (even amplifying the same aspect again if you want to) until you have something you're excited about.

When your rot is complete you'll note it in your notebook. Since the rot is one of the starting points of your game, it should be one of the first things you write. You'll add to it later as you go. To start with, at the top level write a quick description of your rot. Below it note an idea for what fear inspired it and at least one question for a future plan it might achieve and at least one impression for something

For example: I fear for the future of our environment. This is not particularly manifest, specific, or beyond reality. I'll start with moving it beyond reality. I listened to a podcast about the fungus network that connects trees and how it resembles the connections in a brain, so let's start with that: trees are all part of a massive uber-organism that isn't obvious because it moves so slowly compared to humans. Next I'll work on specific. Since I've arleady moved trees beyond reality I'll make that the specific rot, trees fighting back. A brain of trees fighting back is specific and beyond reality, but so far it isn't manifest—trees don't have much effect on our day to day life. So maybe some chemical spill or polution has given trees the ability to grow and move in ways they otherwise wouldn't. This is both manifest (I can imagine houses with roots running through every wall and crawlspace, ready to strike) and deniable (the trees won't be marching down the street or anything). This is feeling pretty good to me, so I take a few notes and move on.

If you like you can view many works of fiction through this lense too. Lovecraft's stories of slave species taking over fallen civilizations and dark foreigners with forbidden knowledge are his fears of minorities made manifest, specific, deniable, and beyond reality. The conspiracy of _True Detective_ is a fear of the powerful preying on the rich taken to the extreme.

## Agents

Agents are the ways the rot acts on the world. They may be intentionally employed or they may be side effects (or unwitting allies), but they are the ways the rot spreads and fights back.

Once you have the rot planned, decide how many agents it has, from 2-5. The more agents the rot has the more powerful it is and the longer your game will run, in general, because it will have more ways to fight against the player characters. 2 agents is good for a one-shot, whereas 5 could last you many sessions. Under your rot entry add a question to be resolved for each agent, but just put the mark (‣), don't write anything next to them yet.

Each agent is a person, organization, resource, or ability the rot has. They can vary in scope and power; both Principle Fullerton and A Corportate Black Ops Team can be agents. The type of agents you give the rot are a way to indicate its power. Giving the rot agents with broad skills will give it more ways to fight back. If you see the rot as massively powerful give it allies that are powerful and protected, like corrupt politicians and powerful corporations. If you see the rot as a more local threat give it local sources of power, like the local country club or a mad genius. 

To find the agents of the rot, ask yourself:

- Who benefits from the rot's goals?
- Who could be swayed by the rot's appeal?
- Who despises those the rot would consume?

No need to answer all three, just keep asking whichever sounds interesting until you've found as many agents as you need.

### Undefined Agents

The rot is powerful and pernicious and can have far-reaching plans, which is a lot to ask of a GM. Sure, the head of the Midas Corporation has plans within plans to protest his investment in a small cult that may have found an alternate reality, but you as the GM may not want to figure out all those plans ahead of time.

To make your rot more adaptable you can leave some of its agents undefined and add them during play. This allows the rot to be 'prepared' for what the players do without you planning for every eventuality.

During play you can add an agent in an open slot:

- When the players do something that no other agent seems suitable to countering
- When some new aspect of the rot becomes manifest and an idea strikes you
- When the rot needs to do something and no existing agent fits

Leaving your agents undefined is a good idea as long as your players are okay with it, as it lets you portray a more powerful rot without having to be as samrt and far-thinking as that rot.
