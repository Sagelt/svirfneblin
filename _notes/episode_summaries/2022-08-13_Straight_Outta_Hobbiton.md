title: Straight Outta Hobbiton
---

When [[Bilbo Baggins]] summons his most adventurous cousins to [[Bag End]] to recruit some of them to retrieve the Old Took's map from Mathom House Lobelia tries to worm her way in.

As the cousins journey to Mitchel Delving they must face river crossings, nosy Hobbits, and a particularly sharp owl. Can they make their way into Mathom House, past the guard dog, and return the map? Or will The Conspiracy of The Red Book be broken up before it even gets started?
