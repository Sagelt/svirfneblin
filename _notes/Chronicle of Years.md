# 2960
2960 was played over these sessions:
* [[2022-08-13 Straight Outta Hobbiton]]
* [[2022-08-20 Golf Clap]]

In late spring [[Bilbo Baggins]] summons his cousins and recruits four of them ([[Drogo Baggins]], [[Esmerelda Took]], [[Paladin Took II]], and [[Rorimac Brandybuck]]) to retrieve the Old Took's map of The Shire from Mathom House in Michel Delving. Invigorated by their success and tales of adventure Bilbo dubs the group The Conspiracy of The Red Book and decides to set off on another adventure with them.

The conspiracy then goes about The Shire recovering interesting items including The Bullroarer's Club.
