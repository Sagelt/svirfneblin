# [[2022-08-20 Golf Clap]]

Bilbo discovers the location of the Bullroarer's Club and enlists the Conspiracy of the Red Book to recover it. A chance meeting on the road is neither early nor late, but happens exactly when it was meant to.

The trail of the club eventually leads to a pre-dawn showdown with a stone troll. Will the Conspiracy survive it's first real battle?

# [[2022-09-03 Unaccompanied Miners]]

A journey to find [[Gandalf The Grey]]'s fireworks takes The Conspiracy of The Red Book on a roundabout trail that eventually, after many Bracegirdles and Boffins are interviewed, to Scary on the trail of [[Bruno Hardbottle]].

Information from Filibert Banks leads the Conspiracy underground where they find [[The Last Orc of Scary]], but will this ancient orc be too great a battle for a few Hobbits and one old dwarf?

# [[2022-09-10 Letter Press]]

The adventures of [[Rorimac Brandybuck]], [[Drogo Baggins]], [[Paladin Took II]], and [[Balin]] finally catch up to them when they are rounded up by bounders as disturbers of the peace. This being The Shire the punishment is vicious: temporary community service delivering the Quick Post.

The conspirators are given a letter Postmaster Odo received from a hooded tall-folk to deliver to Bam-Furlong. And what better way to deliver the post than on some borrowed velocipedes?

But this is no Hobbit-walk and the conspirators must resort to foraging cabbage and berries. A chance meeting with Galdor of the Havens leads to elf-draught which may be key when the companions come across wolves moving on Bam-Furlong!

With the wolves dispatched and the post delivered the conspirators are welcomed into Bam-Furlong by Farmer Maggot only to find [[Bilbo Baggins]] there waiting for them!
