Bilbo discovers the location of the Bullroarer's Club and enlists the Conspiracy of the Red Book to recover it. A chance meeting on the road is neither early nor late, but happens exactly when it was meant to.

The trail of the club eventually leads to a pre-dawn showdown with a stone troll. Will the Conspiracy survive it's first real battle?
