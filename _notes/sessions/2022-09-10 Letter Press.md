# Summary

The adventures of [[Rorimac Brandybuck]], [[Drogo Baggins]], [[Paladin Took II]], and [[Balin]] finally catch up to them when they are rounded up by bounders as disturbers of the peace. This being The Shire the punishment is vicious: temporary community service delivering the Quick Post.

The conspirators are given a letter Postmaster Odo received from a hooded tall-folk to deliver to Bam-Furlong. And what better way to deliver the post than on some borrowed velocipedes?

But this is no Hobbit-walk and the conspirators must resort to foraging cabbage and berries. A chance meeting with Galdor of the Havens leads to elf-draught which may be key when the companions come across wolves moving on Bam-Furlong!

With the wolves dispatched and the post delivered the conspirators are welcomed into Bam-Furlong by Farmer Maggot only to find [[Bilbo Baggins]] there waiting for them!
