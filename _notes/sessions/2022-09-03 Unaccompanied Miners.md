# Summary

A journey to find [[Gandalf The Grey]]'s fireworks takes The Conspiracy of The Red Book on a roundabout trail that eventually, after many Bracegirdles and Boffins are interviewed, to Scary on the trail of [[Bruno Hardbottle]].

Information from Filibert Banks leads the Conspiracy underground where they find [[The Last Orc of Scary]], but will this ancient orc be too great a battle for a few Hobbits and one old dwarf?
