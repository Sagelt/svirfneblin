description: An Apocalypse World mod where the supervillains won.

The villains won. No one is quite sure how, but everyone knows the outcome: cities burning, society in chaos then collapse, families set to panicked flight, the weird nights when the smoldering sky made midnight into a blood-colored half-day.

Whatever your powers were, this is what you are now. Diminished, but not dead.

Now the world is not what it was. Look around you: evidently, certainly, not what it was. But also close your eyes, open your brain: something is wrong. At the limits of perception, something howling, everpresent, full of hate and terror. From this, the world’s psychic maelstrom, we none of us have

# About
Apocalypse 616 is a lightweight reskinning of D. Vincent Baker and Megeuy Baker's [Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com/) based on Old Man Logan from Wolverine #66–72. It's heavily influenced by [Jay & Miles X-Plain The X-Men](http://www.xplainthexmen.com/), especially [their episode on Old Man Logan](http://www.xplainthexmen.com/2017/03/149-panning-for-callbacks/).

You'll need a copy of Apocalypse World to play ([you should buy it](http://apocalypse-world.com/)) and read Old Man Logan for inspiration ([you should buy that too](http://amzn.to/2n8Hzxm)).
